  <h3>PRODUCT DESCRIPTIONS</h3>
  <p>Colonial Heritage Foundation attempts to be as accurate as possible. However, Colonial Heritage Foundation does not warrant that product descriptions or other content of any Colonial Heritage Foundation Service is accurate, complete, reliable, current, or error-free. If a product offered by Colonial Heritage Foundation itself is not as described, your sole remedy is to return it in unused condition.</p>
  <h3>OTHER BUSINESSES</h3>
  <p>Parties other than Colonial Heritage Foundation operate stores, provide services, or sell product lines through the Colonial Heritage Foundation Services. In addition, we provide links to the sites of affiliated companies and certain other businesses. We are not responsible for examining or evaluating, and we do not warrant the offerings of, any of these businesses or individuals or the content of their Web sites. Colonial Heritage Foundation does not assume any responsibility or liability for the actions, product, and content of all these and any other third parties. You should carefully review their privacy statements and other conditions of use.</p>
  <h3>DISPUTES</h3>
  <p>Any dispute or claim relating in any way to your use of any Colonial Heritage Foundation Service, or to any products or services sold or distributed by Colonial Heritage Foundation or through Colonial Heritage Foundation.com will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that you may assert claims in small claims court if your claims qualify. The Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law apply to this agreement.</p>
  <p>There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited. However, an arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court (including injunctive and declaratory relief or statutory damages), and must follow the terms of these Conditions of Use as a court would.</p>
  <p>To begin an arbitration proceeding, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your claim to our registered agent Corporation Service Company, 300 Deschutes Way SW, Suite 304, Tumwater, WA 98501. The arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its rules, including the AAA's Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes. The AAA's rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879. Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA's rules. We will reimburse those fees for claims totaling less than $10,000 unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous. Likewise, Colonial Heritage Foundation will not seek attorneys' fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous. You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person in the county where you live or at another mutually agreed location.</p>
  <p>We each agree that any dispute resolution proceedings will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated or representative action. If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration we each waive any right to a jury trial. We also both agree that you or we may bring suit in court to enjoin infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights.</p>
  <h3>APPLICABLE LAW</h3>
  <p>By using any Colonial Heritage Foundation Service, you agree that the Federal Arbitration Act, applicable federal law, and the laws of the state of Washington, without regard to principles of conflict of laws, will govern these Conditions of Use and any dispute of any sort that might arise between you and Colonial Heritage Foundation.</p>
  <h3>SITE POLICIES, MODIFICATION, AND SEVERABILITY</h3>
  <p>Please review our other policies, such as our pricing policy, posted on this site. These policies also govern your use of Colonial Heritage Foundation Services. We reserve the right to make changes to our site, policies, Service Terms, and these Conditions of Use at any time.
